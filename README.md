# Tkinter Learning Projects

## Introduction
This repository showcases projects developed during my learning journey with the Tkinter library, each designed to explore key concepts of building graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and demonstrate the practical application of visual components in Python.

## Projects
- `task-app/` : A simple task management application with functionality to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed. It explores the use of widgets such as `Label`, `Entry`, `Button`, `Frame`, `Canvas`, and `Scrollbar`, as well as event handling and layout organization in Tkinter.

## Installation
To run these scripts on your local machine, you'll need to have Python and the Tkinter library installed. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/), and use the following command to install Tkinter (if needed): pip install tk

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory where the script you want to run is located.
3. Execute the script using Python.
